##Task Title: Personal Portfolio Webpage
Objective:
The aim of this task was to create and implement a responsive, clean, modern, and animated personal portfolio webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The emphasis was to display personal and professional data in a clean, modern, and animated way and implement front-end design practices and animation libraries.

Description:
This website is a personal portfolio to meet the developer â€” with minimum profile information, skill sets, contact data, and references to external sites such as LinkedIn. It is made user-friendly as well as aesthetic, showing principal skills in web development and UI/UX design.

The layout was made by utilizing semantic HTML5 elements. The website has an animated gradient fixed background, designed by using CSS @keyframes, which provides movement and visual appeal. The content is positioned in the middle and made visible within card-like boxes to divide distinct sections like About Me, Skills, and Contact. This layout creates readability and simplicity in navigation.

Styling employed contemporary CSS with a subtle pastel color scheme. The background is a smooth animated gradient that transitions from dusty green, lavender, pink, to pale blue, while the cards employ a clean white foundation with faint shadows. Headings employed a green accent color for contrast and emphasis. The layout is responsive and stays centered throughout different screen sizes.

JavaScript alongside the GSAP library was employed to introduce smooth entrance animations to the content. Features such as the name, LinkedIn logo, and all the content sections are revealed with staggered effects, and this improves the user interface and demonstrates animation prowess.

The LinkedIn logo is clickable and opens the developer's LinkedIn profile in a new window. Scaling transitions and hover effects add more interactivity to give the website a dynamic and professional touch.

Conclusion:
This assignment proves the skill to create and design a neat, animated personal webpage from the ground up. It showcases the developer's knowledge of the structure of HTML, responsive CSS design, and contemporary JavaScript animation methods with GSAP. The result is a portfolio that is professional in nature, which can be utilized in searching for a job or internship and as a demonstration of web development proficiency.
